# CSS Flex Layout Exercise

This project is a sample exercise to investigate the use of CSS grid and flexbox for creating multi-column layouts. The goal is to understand how modern CSS layout techniques can be used to build responsive and visually appealing web pages.

## Project Structure

- `index.html` — Main HTML file containing the layout structure.
- `styles/reset.css` — CSS reset to ensure consistent styling across browsers.
- `styles/style.css` — Main stylesheet implementing the 3-column layout using Flexbox.
- `README.md` — Project documentation and instructions.

## Exercise Overview

- The layout features a navigation header and three columns, styled using Flexbox properties.
- The exercise demonstrates how to use `display: flex`, `flex-direction`, `justify-content`, and `align-items` to arrange elements in a row and control spacing.
- The project can be extended to compare Flexbox and CSS Grid approaches for similar layouts.

## How to Use

1. Open `index.html` in your browser to view the layout.
2. Modify `styles/style.css` to experiment with different Flexbox or Grid properties.
3. Try converting the layout to use CSS Grid and observe the differences.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the basics of Flexbox and CSS Grid.
- Practice building multi-column layouts.
